# RetroFE-Metadata-Tool
Tool which eases the management of metadata for a RetroFE setup. Particularly in a Linux environment

This script works based on the following assumptions:

1. 	You're using RetroFE (http://retrofe.nl).
2.	You've used XMS (https://github.com/Universal-Rom-Tools/Universal-XML-Scraper) to scrape your metadata using the RetroPIE format.
3.	You've used the retrofeConvert (https://github.com/JamesInDigital/retrofeConvert) tool from JamesInDigital to create your gamelists and story folder. I've made a modified (incomplete) version of this script and will link it here as soon as I publish it.
4.	You're using a linux-based system
5. 	That you've configured XMS to pull down the coverart as the "default" image and the logo as the "marquee".
